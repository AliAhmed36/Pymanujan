# PyCalc
### Python powered Calculator. As simple as that.
#### Introduction
Whole code is written in pure Python. Moreover, as a beginner myself, new developers and contribtors can easily go through the code to understand the logic behind the program. I tried to include as much as comments and documentations within the code itself. Feel free to ping me for any updates. This program has a lot of scope for improvement. Development best-suited for new developers and programmers, this simple program provides a stage for immense develpoment of one's skill, expertise and familiarity of Python programming language.

Currently the program supports 'Addition', 'Subtraction', 'Multiplication' and 'Division'. Check Tasks List issues pending on *feature-requests*. Check Contribution for more details to get started on developing the program.

#### User interface of PyCalc *v0.1*

![As of v1.1](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gkaizf70hydnMf4Ppa2iidNCKzeLiDjl?usp=sharing)

#### Tasks List
- [x] Refactor ~~source.py~~ source code.
- [x] Add 'Copy' functionality, to copy the result. Currently 'Copy' button does not do anything.
- [x] Dynamic font size in result label.
- [x] Bind 'Number-pad' keys to enter input.
- [ ] Option to switch between 'Simple' to 'Advanced' mode. Advanced mode should have more funtionalities.

#### Contribution
All are welcome to contribute to this project. Start from going through the ```source.py``` which has good amount comments and documentation along the code. Currently the focus is on improving the GUI. Create an *Issue* and start a discussion before working on a seperate *Fork*, collabaration always results in better ideas!

Goal towards your contribution should always be to improve expertise on Python.
> Though a calculator app is no path-breaking project to work on, it gives confidence to a new-devloper the abilty to build something from scratch.

#### Note for Linux users:
For 'Copy' button to work as intended, make sure ```xclip``` is installed.
