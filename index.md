# PyCalc
### Python powered Calculator. As simple as that.
#### Introduction
Whole code is written in pure Python. Moreover, as a beginner myself, new developers and contribtors can easily go through the code to understand the logic behind the program. I tried to include as much as comments and documentations within the code itself. Feel free to ping me for any queries. This program has a lot of scope for improvement. **Development best-suited for new developers and programmers**, this simple program provides a stage for immense develpoment of one's skill, expertise and familiarity of Python programming language.

Currently the program supports 'Addition', 'Subtraction', 'Multiplication' and 'Division'. Check Tasks List issues pending on *feature-requests*. Check Contribution for more details to get started on developing the program.

#### User interface of PyCalc *v0.1*

![As of v1.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maddypie/PyCalc/master/PyCalc-v1.0.png)

#### Tasks List
- [x] Refactor ~~source.py~~ source code.
- [x] Add 'Copy' functionality, to copy the result. Currently 'Copy' button does not do anything.
- [x] Dynamic font size in result label.
- [x] Bind 'Number-pad' keys to enter input.
- [ ] Option to switch between 'Simple' to 'Advanced' mode. Advanced mode should have more funtionalities.

#### Contribution
All are welcome to contribute to this project. **Documentation will be out soon.** Currently the focus is on improving the GUI layout and themes for PyCalc. Create an *Issue* and start a discussion before working on a seperate *Fork*, collabaration always results in better ideas! The code base is failry small and modular. As mentioned before, feel free to ping me for any clarrifications.

Goal towards your contribution should always be to improve expertise on Python.

#### Note for Linux users:
For 'Copy' button to work as intended, make sure ```xclip``` is installed.
